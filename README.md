# Time-Series-Forecasting
What is a time series?

To keep it simple, a time series is a set of observations taken sequentially in time. The focus is on the
word time. If we keep taking the same observation at different points in time, we will get a time series.
For example, if you keep recording the number of bars of chocolate you have in a month, you'll end
up with a time series of your chocolate consumption. Suppose you are recording your weight at the
beginning of every month. You get another time series of your weight. Is there any relation between
the two time series? Most likely, yeah. But we can analyze that scientifically by the end of this book.

A few other examples of time series are the weekly closing price of a stock that you follow, daily rainfall
or snow in your city, or hourly readings of your heartbeat from your smartwatch.
